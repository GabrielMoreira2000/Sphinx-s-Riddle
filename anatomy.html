<!--The Mysterious Corpse of the Effra-->
<!--In the late 19th century, a coffin was spotted floating in the Thames.--> 
<!--It seemed to have come all the way from West Norwood Cemetery, yet the grave itself was found to be undisturbed.-->
<!--Investigations revealed that the grave had been dug too close to the course of the Effra, which runs beneath the cemetery.--> 
<!--The coffin had been washed into the river and floated for miles underneath South London, all the way to the Thames at Vauxhall.-->
