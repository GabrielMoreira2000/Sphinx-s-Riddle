<!--Sergei Vasilyevich Avdeyev holds the world record for time travel by a human being.-->
<!--Throughout his 748-day mission aboard the Mir space station, he hurtled through space at 17,200 mph (27,700 km/h).-->
<!--This prolonged high-speed journey made him about two tenths of a second younger than he would have been if he had spent his whole life on earth.-->
