<h1>Mankind</h1>
    <p>Eons after The Big Bang, somewhere in the universe a huge cloud of gases started to gather. This cloud got bigger and denser, because of this it started to rotate on itself. In the center a huge blinding star was formed by gases, sometime after, other little planets began to gather around this star.
</p>
<p>And one very interesting planet caught my attention. It was the third from the star, it began as nothing really, but after some accretion, volcanic outgassing and millions of meteor hits. It became something. It toke a while but life began to develop there. Where it came from? Some say it came falling down in a meteor after countless years in space.  Others say there carbon based molecules developed themselves from the far depths of the oceans. Either way it is not important. What is important is what happened next.</p>
<p>Next, these harmless microscopic beings evolved in the incredible harsh environment. They got bigger, more complex, better. And, in terms of the universe, a blink of an eye, they left their fluid home and started to roam the terrain. Natural selection continue to do its job of making sure that the species only got tougher, faster, smarter. </p>
<p>Before they knew it they were all over the globe, living a life of fighting for food, shelter and territory. There were some mass extinctions every millions of years, but they always survived though it as a whole.</p>
<p>This circle of nature kept at it, for couple of millions of years, until it reached a turning point. Amidst the confusion one very special creature got too smart for its own good, and just like that this planet officially doomed itself. These ignorant did not know it yet but their species were going to become the gods of this planet. Leave the food chain and get so giant that they were causing extinctions without even knowing it.</p>
<p>These carbon based molecules actually became sentient and started a chain of ground breaking discoveries and endless steps to understanding themselves, others, and the universe itself. Of course their own private evolution toke quite a long time, for various reasons. </p>
<p>For starts these little creatures were not ready for these huge power and responsibility, and they still are not. </p>
<p>Some of them have come to the conclusion that they were not ruining their home planet, but themselves. Oh yes these smartasses were not only killing off others species without knowing, but they were in every way leading to their own extinction. Because, what they call Mother Nature, will live own. Even after the total atomic annihilation or the never ending infections from bacteria or whatever kills them. Plants will grow back, other beings will walk, fly, slither, or whatever suits them, the planet once again. And everything that happen before was merely another extinction. But why are these full of potential creatures so self-destructive? </p>
<p>It was all the work of their beloved nature. Seeing that the bastards keep surviving and evolving though everything that it threw at them. Animal attacks, droughts, floods, eruptions and earthquakes.</p>
<p>Nature being the kind and cruel mistress she is. Aware of their potential to overtake her power over the world and its residents. Planted a little fuck you present, a fail-safe mechanism call it. Deep inside their incomparable complex brain there is the triune brain or more specifically, the reptilian complex. </p>
<p>And because of this tiny space of neuropathways, while they were busy building and creating. Unconsciously they were carefully placing the domino pieces to their extinction. But when was the first piece placed?
   </p> <p>Their downfall started with a mask of hope.</p>
<p>During their first centuries they had already occupied the globe. And never the less all of the different isolated societies made the same mistake.
  </p><p>  Someone in the middle of this, was just too smart. He or she witnessed all of the pain and hunger that plagued its people and wanted to bring comfort with a fairy tale he conjured. He told his people that there was a supreme being above, watching them. And when they died there was a special and happy place for them, or their (souls” were reincarnated into other beings.
)  </p>    
<p>Understandably afraid of death, his people ate this make believe up without thought. It is better to believe that a supreme being created you and is watching over you, and he loves you. Then to acknowledge how shitty their life was. They choose illusion over despair. They had no method of proving he did not exist, or why they were there, or why the grass grew and why that huge star was there and sometimes it was not. They dropped their responsibility and critical thinking that got them to create fire, the wheel, language.
 </p><p>   And started to worship him or her, everyone is imaginary friend, the one that created everything they knew. Began praying. And praying that this creature would help them with their minor inconveniences, and every time that their dreams came true it was because their prayer had been answered. And every time it was not, it because it is all apart his divine plan. For he had to give them happiness and pain. They absolutely adored the idea of him. 
</p><p>His name and his story, changes from society to society, according to the different problems from the environment. But regarding the details of the alpha and the omega. They all have something in common.    
</p><p>If they love him, he would give those gifts, the harvest, protect the children from animals.
</p><p>Now the ones that invented the answer to all, saw their power over the desperate population and got drunk on it.
</p><p>They knew that for a society to function as one they needed order. But how could they control a crowd that thinks whatever they did, they had a place reserved in a good home after death?
</p><p>Well. It was then when they realized that the best way to control people was though fear.
</p><p>They filled their heads with scary stories, scaring them into behaving. Terrifying people from stealing, killing, lying. 
</p><p>Since they could not mix the idea of a supreme being that loves you and gives you food, with a negative thought of one that punishes you if you’ve been dishonest. They created another, one that lives sorely to hurt you if have been bad.
    </p><p>His name and origin changes from place to place, but his purpose is the same. Scaring the ignorant from hurtful acts and intensifying their love and need for the hand that feeds them.  
    </p><p> At that time, to have order one cannot live without the other, they needed someone to look up to. And just like that people were behaving and helping others. All thanks to the first domino. Wishful Thinking.
    </p><p> Quickly this social infrastructure grew out of proportions.
    </p><p>Their love for a supreme being got so embedded into their existence, that when they meet someone with a different believe but equal affinity for it. It was seen as an insult to everything they desperately wanted to be real.
</p><p> And just like that they were back to killing each other, but this time it was not for food or shelter. This time they had no real reason or purpose, except the idea of the existence of another supreme entity. Which by itself was unbearable and outrageous. 
</p><p>Of course the victories fell to those with better resources and weapons, and everyone else with different characteristics, believes or methods. Were seen as a threat. Tribalism.
</p><p> And this flaw was here to stay. Participating in countless wars, slavery, torture, attempted extermination of tribes and believes, and more.    
</p><p>Since Christianity was clearly the one with better results in wars, I will be referring a lot to it. The Bible is currently the world is favorite theatrical play, pure sci-fi. Its followers are practically addicts of hope and faith. They need him to free them from responsibility.
</p><p>How many wars were declared in his name?
</p><p> What was the backbone of their logic for slavery, homophobic and racist behavers?
</p><p>These followers who found a scapegoat of reality, these followers who are too afraid to believe in the truth. Who find comfort in their imaginary friend, and tell themselves that what they did was right, for it was the will of God. These people have no idea that there is no order, no moral compass, nothing.
</p><p>It is all make-believe from exclusive groups meant to contain and control them behind a waterfall of stories.    
</p><p>Something you will not find in the Bible is consistency. Throughout the ages Christianity has adapted itself to the advancement of science and the different ideals that came with it. For example, the heliocentric model. A theory from Copernicus and immediately adopted by the church. It really got their dicks hard to think that they stood at the center of the universe, and what did they say? But of course! It was all god is plan. Then Galileo showed up with a better theory, but, since it contradicted the church. They had to silence him nicely.
</p><p>After they admitted that the earth was not the center of the universe.  Same thing appended with The Big Bang theory by Stephen Hawking. When they learned that the universe came from a cosmic explosion that could blind our eyes. They put on their bullshit hats and started talking how this proves that god exists. All because in an old overrated theatrical prop there is a phrase (let there be light” from Genesis. How fuckin) convenient!
</p><p>Luckily science most of the times is there contradict religion with hard proven facts. That is why there has been a war between these twillparties. One offers comfort through superstition, while the other shows the hard truth through theories and experiments. There has been a war of knowledge and ideals for centuries now.                                
</p><h2>Science</h2>    
<p>What distinguish us as sentient beings is our strong thirst for understanding the unknown. More questions we answer, more are made. The purpose of science is purely to understand the mysteries of the cosmos, advance technology and improve our way of life as a whole. Seeing scientists as agents of truth and knowledge.
</p><p>Of course this was the plan, but the core of science has been corrupted by many exterior factors. Since it was invented, science has been in a war with the faithful, the church. But do not get me wrong. No matter how much I love seeing science crush faith. Our science is far from perfect, because we are far from perfect. It is all about how we use the technology we invent. While we can use science to improve our way of live, we also use it to destroy others. We can use hydrogen propellants to transport ships to space, but also to increase the reach of our thermonuclear nuclear missiles. Another example is gunpowder. Originally used in fireworks, mostly used to kill each other. There are countless inventions with the sole purpose to hurt or kill others from the same species.
</p><p>In the hands of the Homo sapiens, science is in fact a double-edged sword. We need to conquer our inner demons if we can truly evolve as a species. More on that later.     
 </p><h2>Nowadays</h2>   
<p>Nowadays a lot has changed, I mean plenty has happen. Overall it is a complete shit show. More specifically, 80% of the world is wealth is controlled by 1% of the population and its only getting worse. Furthermore, that one percent afraid of power in numbers of the other 99%, likes to keep them ignorant and entertained. A sort of hypnosis call it.
</p><p>The world is run by a couple suited, narcissistic, greedy, self-indulging little twats. Who have complete control over society... Sometimes hiding behind religion, sometimes under fabricated authority. 
</p><p> Everything from society is corrupted and tainted imputing such a foul smell of its motives and hidden agendas. But do the people notice? No, they were programed to be totally submissive. Others do not want to believe it is true so it is back to illusion over despair.
</p><p>But how do the wealthy 1% keep the rest ignorant?
</p><p>It starts with education provided to them from the beginning. Schools, a symbol of knowledge and learning became factories of planted truths and goals in life. Designed to bend the kids to the will of its corporate masters. Parents were to send their children to these brainwashing factories, to strip the child of individuality and turned into a mindless obedient dead soul with artificial goals to fit in a conservative and consumer culture.
</p><p>And what were they to find in society with this sick mentality? Entertainment.
</p><p>Something to keep them asleep while their lives are slowly cut away. They find comfort in reality shows meant to numb the mind and keep them ignorant. If you truly want to control the masses, what do you do? Do you impose martial law? Do you maintain absolute and total control and order? No. What you do is oversee the information that reaches your people. By controlling their knowledge and ideas, you control how they think, how their feel towards certain matters and how they act. You see this kind of smooth manipulation in a lot of places. North Korea, a place who survives only on their reinforced ideology that their country is the best, and everyone else are enemies of the state trying to destroy the safe haven that our great leaders worked so hard to create. Especially those American pigs. Strangely enough, the exact thing happens in the USA. 
</p><p>They seem to take pride on being an American, resident of the so called land of the free and the brave.  I mean who would not? Who would not take pride on being a part of a cruel greedy hypocrite country, run by white christen bankers? Pretending to be a democracy while completely obliterating everyone who opposes or even has something that they want. With complete disregard for anyone that is different in anyway. I call it hypocrite for various reasons. Because while they were happy with their American exceptionalism as a reasoning behind the almost genocide of the Native American, but now they must not let any sort of immigrant come into their great nation and destroy their customs. Another great example in the concentration camps. You know, the ones that they are so proud that they liberated in Ww2, from the nasty Nazis, while neglecting the fact that themselves made concentration camps for the Japanese-Americans shortly after Pearl Harbor where so many great men died protecting their country. So the only logical idea was to get all the ones related to those evil genes and put them in a hole. But my favorite example of this complex façade of security and freedom (which by the way do not match) is when in the southern states the government decided to take down statues of white supremacists slave owners, although honestly the USA is built on a foundation of slave owners who told us (All men are created equal, instead of blacks, Indians, and women). And the workers uncharged of taking down the statues had to be protected by the police. Because they were afraid that some hillbilly could come and hurt the workers for disrespecting their way of live. If only there was a word for that. I mean it ca not be terrorists because they are not brown, I guess misguided patriots? You see? Its twosides of the same coin.
</p><p>Not only that, but their burning love for war: the war for independence, the civil war, Ww1, Ww2, the cold war, the war in Vietnam, the Korean war, and the war in the middle east. Mark Twain once said (God created war to teach Americans geography). The homeland tries very hard to keep its proud and (free” citizens with a close and narrow mind )f their enemies. Painting them with a paper thin and easy to understand motive for their actions. To destroy the free country that they live in. And may god punish them for it, and their false prophets too. That is why there is numerous military cemeteries packed brainwashed dead soldiers, who thought that god was on their side. Convinced the enemy was the agent of the Devil, so they fought when the Blitzkrieg rained and the bodies stank. There is wise quote that goes like (In war its best not to understand your enemy because if I understand my enemy I also love him).  
</p><p>It is this constant flow of bullshit that keeps their minds dull. Someone also said (If you raise a child with a simple mentality even when they are old enough to reach the age of reason, they will still hold on to their roots). If all the bullshit was cut off from their everyday lives, the system would collapse. Into a giant steaming pile of bullshit coated in white, red and blue. 
</p><p>Someone once asked Gandhi what he thought of western civilization. And he replied (I think it would be a wonderful idea).
</p><p>Another way to keep the masses busy in a capitalist land, is by turning it into a consumer society where material possessions are the way of live.      
</p><p>They love big sales on possessions, because if you buy you will feel better about your shitty life. Citizens have sold their soul for material goods nowadays.
</p><p>The only thing in mind is the new couch from the store, or when they are going to get that promotion so that they can buy more unnecessary garbage. This consumer society has its inhabitants hooked on buying and buying to no end.
</p><p>We admire and have to follow the footsteps of our idols. Why is it that we all collectively agreed that Steve Jobs was a great man, when we knew he made millions of the back of children? Is it because we know inside that all of our heroes and celebrities are fake, artificial, and pointless? Or is it that we wanted to be ignorant?
</p><p>Spending hours on social media meant to fake intimacy. Running never ending commentary bullshit masquerading as insight. Since when did we become so pretentious, for our hypocrite followers? 
</p><p>Social media. Where we pretend we care about others. Where we go to rant about our stupid ideals, filling the internet> with our junk. And showcasing it as the arrogant idiots we were raised to be.
</p><p>Everybody absolutely needs to be happy.
</p><p>If you are not. You need help. Take some pills. Go do one of our mind-numbing activities. You need to be happy to fit in this bipolar society we created. Sure evolution made anger so that you would know about the unfair system you are in, and do something about it. Anger gets shit done. But we do not want you to be angry, look at all these happy people in commercials. Happier than a Hindu cow. You know why? Because they buy our products!
</p><p>If you want to stop having such a shitty life style, then buy things! You should feel right as rain! Happy, like those actors on the television. Not angry enough to the point where you actually engage in confrontation to make your life better. No sir. What you need is happiness. Be content in this fuckup society. Work hard so that you can buy more stuff to make you feel better about yourself. Shop until you drop!
</p><p>Let me tell you this, I hate our society. I am just sick of the constant bullshit and hypocrisy. All those fake smiles, all those backroom deals that run every country. But especially how everyone is a coward, it is only this bad because we let it. Because we are too afraid to open the rotten curtain that is been with us for so long. Nothing feels real anymore. Nothing is real anymore. We live in a world built on fantasy, synthetic emotions in form of pills, psychological warfare in the form of advertising, mind altering chemicals in the form of food, brain-washing seminars in the form of media, controlled isolated bobbles in the form of social media. We tossed reality into the expanding dumpster of the human condition. Our way of live is trademarked by corporations built by bipolar numbers jumping up and down on a digital display, hypnotizing us into the greatest slumber that mankind as ever known. I refuse to become just another cog in corporate machine, pumping out more bullshit into others’ lives so that I can get a one week vacation in an exotic island.I refuse to turn my live into one big hoax devoid of meaning.
   </p><h2>My reality & ideology</h2> 
<p>Reality is how you perceive the world, everyone has a different reality. And my reality is dark. I found the truth between the lines in a book full of lies. 
    
</p><p>As you can probably tell by now, I am not a religious person. I do not believe in any supreme being. But that is not all, I do not have a moral compass to hold me back. To me there is no right or wrong, no good or bad, they are simply artificial constructs. In my opinion you have the right to do whatever you want. I do not think there is a right thing to do and a wrong thing. Right about now you are probably very skeptical about my sanity. But let me develop this idea. We can all agree that morality is not directly connected to the laws of the state. For various reasons. There were acts that were legal but now we see them as immoral. Concentration camps, wife abuse. But back then they were morally accepted. And that is where I put my foot down. Our sense of what is right or what is wrong changes with time like our own laws. The line separating good and bad, is extremely irregular, ambiguous. And in every conflict regarding morality there is always separate opinions. And who are we to say that they are wrong and we are right. It is not black and white, it is a grey blurry line, morality. So I say why bother? Since morality is not a fixed and constant point where everybody can agree on it, why pretend it exist? There is only what is legal and what is illegal. And that is something that a bunch of white christen males decided a long time ago in a room. Why should I follow blindly their rules? Why ca not I kill a corporate boss with a gun, while he kills slowly entire families with rigged financial deals or by hiding the terrible living conditions that they live in? What is the difference? Why do I have to follow the rules, if even the ones who control them ignore them? I dropped my sympathy for the human race along time ago. So my deal with society is, I will do want I want until you catch me. Nobody has restrictions for what they can do, because there is no such thing as human rights. There is not and there never was. Rights are not rights if someone can just take them away. And we see this constantly happening. You do not have rights if the government can just take them away in a blink of an eye. They are privileges, nothing more.  
</p><p>Another thing that I believe it was nothing to do with good or bad, are words. Simply words. Are not you sick of hearing that you ca not say that because it is a bad word? I am. I think that what needs to be taken into consideration is the context in what those words are used. The words themselves mean no harm, they are neutral, sterile. It is the person who says them that is good or bad. For example, niggers. Nowadays if a white neo-Nazi calls somebody a nigger it is because he is a racist prick. But we did not bat an eye when Tupac or Ludacris say the same thing. You know why? Because we know they are not racist, they are niggers. It is all about the context in how it is said. It is the person who you ought to be concerned about and the hate behind their words. I like to say what I see. I bear no hatred or disgust in my words. Hell, I know that I am a whitey boy, antisocial freak with a psychopath tendencies. But I still say and know that there is still a bigot and a racist cunt in almost every home, in every street in the country. Although they lie to seem nice and fit into society. That is the problem. I do not like words that hide the things they are meant to represent. Words that take conceal reality. The euphemistic language empties the meaning.  People tend to cover the harsh truth behind soft language to minimize the shock, so that it does not bother them while it should. And it keeps getting worse in each generation. I will give you an example. There is a condition in combat, that when a soldier nervous system has been stressed to its absolute peak and it snaps or it is about to snap. During Ww1 this was called shell shock. And it fits, it delivers the right amount of impact since it is really serious. 
</p><p>During Ww2 this was changed to battle fatigue. It is starting to lose its punch. Does not sound that bad really. Then during the Korean War it was operational exhaustion, sounds like something that happens to your car. And at last the current term to this condition was founded in the war in Vietnam. It is currently known as Post-traumatic stress disorder. We quadruple the amount of syllables so the hurt veterans did not get the attention they deserved. The pain is completely buried under jargon. But this combat condition is not the only example of soft language taking the life out of life. At some point in time toilet paper became bathroom tissue, false teeth became dental appliances, medicine became medication, the dump became the landfill, car crashes became automobile accidents, used cars became previously used transportation, poor people used to live in slums but now the economically disadvantaged occupies housing in the inner cities. And they are no longer broke, they have a negative cash flow position. Smug, greedy, well fed, white people have invented a language to sugar-coat the unpleasant truth, so that nobody actually goes into action. They use this pretentious language to make fancy financial deals meant to rob the people right under their noses. The CIA does not kill people, it neutralizes them. The government does not lie, it engages in misinformation. The Pentagon actually measures radiation in what they call Sunshine units. I am tired of all the grotesque evasions that keep bullshiting the people into believing that if you change the name of the condition you change the actual condition. I miss the simple honest direct language, there is no shame to the word cripple in any dictionary. But no it is the physically challenged. This keeps getting so bad that I would not be surprised if a rape victim becomes an unwilling sperm recipient.
</p><p>Since I am here talking about what I hate about our civilization, I am also going to rant about specific groups who were born in this semi-conscious dimwits who know nothing apart from eating and shopping. I am talking about the ones who are so gaging for attention that they are willing to throw a tantrum for their bullshit cause. And nobody can stop them. You know why? Because that simple honest language is no longer available.
</p><p>Right of the bat, vegans. The ones who like to live in their self-righteous tower gazing down on us because they think not eating meat means they care more about nature, therefore they are better as human beings than everybody else. Let tell you something, its fucking nature animals killing other animals to survive. We are no different. But! For the sake of argument I will look at their key elements to justify their condescending attitude. You say we do not actually need to consume meat, because humans physiologically can survive only on vegetables. Wrong. It is been proven that there is a component in the meat that we need to keep our red cells healthy and functioning. That is why you see them drink that industrial supplement in the middle of their blueberries. Another argument is, since we are intelligent creatures we should not inflict pain on to others species because it is morally wrong. If I ask them what defines something morally wrong, some will say god. Then we are back to that shit again. The smartasses will say it does not have a source. But we ca not inflict pain into a conscious creatures, so we should do it to more simple life forms. I call those smartasses weak-willed and simple minded, while they jack off to their nice sympathy of land creatures, they fail to see the bigger picture. I’ve learned a lot about plants, and I honestly think that plants are more complex than any mammal or insect. And you say they are not conscious, they react to their environment like any other being. If you cut them in certain places, they heal. If you expose one side to sunlight, they grow to that side. They have defense mechanisms for animals and some actually eat them. Life forms are nothings than a bunch of biological and chemical reactions to survive and adapt to the ecosystem. But no, it does not bother so much to kill flora, after all they scream a lot quieter. They do not possess those lungs to scream. To me all life forms have of equal value, none. In case of emergency I do not have a problem in killing a pig or a dog, to eat. It is the beauty of nature, there is no right or wrong. The more adapted, faster, stronger and more intelligent survive. Survival of the fittest means something. Put a proud vegan in the jungle with no supplies, and you will see how quickly he will go back to eating meat to survive. 
</p><p>Second in the list are the feminazis. And oh boy! I have something to say about them. Another arrogant spoiled group born in this artificial reality. First of all I do not hold any disrespect towards women in general. Well. I think respect should not be automatically given, it should be earned. Not only to genres or races but also to parents. If you want me to respect you father fucking do something unique, you raised twillchildren big deal!.. Anyway, first comment to the feminazis is, equality means equal change not equal result. That is not all. Although it is not true, but even if it was. You wanna know why men have that minimum wage gag? Because we do all of the dangerous filthy jobs. Go work at the sewers or dangling down from a telephone post. But that is still not all. There is more. If by any change there is an emergency, you get to leave first with the kids. As soon as those flames breakout you will see the most hardcore feminazis twist their hair into ponytails and acting all girly all of the sudden. That is what you truly want behind your hypocrisy. You do not want equality, you want privileges. They are cherry picking. You take out the bad things of being a guy. No matter how hard you try, men and women are not the same. I believe that men and women should not have equal privileges. Each one has its problems and perks. I was taught that I should never hit a girl, and my sister was taught never to put that rule to the test. So if you really want the perks of being a dude, remember you get the faults. For example, I talking to a guy. Now every guy has a line, a boundary. And if I cross that line I get punched in the face. And that is fair. I learn that maybe I was being a prick. Now no matter how pissed off I am to a girl I ca not punch her. I also have to pay at dates. Risk my life in warfare. Go work at the mines. Protect kids from a bear attack. I mean with equality I would win most cases with custody, I did not have to stay in case of a hostage situation. I did not have to check the strange noise in the middle in the night. Do you really want the full package?                      
</p><p>Coming right up are those pea brain goat fuckers who stand outside abortion clinics protesting. Those who are pro-life or whatever that means. And rant on, how what if Jesus was aborted? Well first of all we would be hundred years more technologically advanced at the current time. Second of all, you are a retard if you think that a fertilized egg has any value. To me, it is all up to the women who carries it. You are the one who gets to choose between nine months of discomfort and pain together with eighteen years of hell and poverty. Or one trip to the clinic, because you were drunk and the douche had a terrible pullout game. The women gets to make that choice, not some unattractive religious fruitcake. Because remember, there is no right or wrong. Only what the laws of science allows you to do.
   </p> <h2>My Solution</h2>
<p>I will now tell you how I think the world should be run and how mankind can evolve. Should we live in a modern capitalist consumer society, or maybe a totalitarian religious nation? Should we dedicate our lives to protect the rich people homes or waste the fruits of our labor to the Vatican as we prey to the lord? I reject those philosophies as backward, they squandered men is prospects, and economies were fractured. I dream of an Eden built by logic where men are not the slaves to their strong greed. Because if you really boil it down, every problem cause by mankind has and always will have a common root. Greed. So I dream of a land where we are wise enough to acknowledge everyone has equals. A place were artists can work free from controversial quarrels and scientists could pioneer beyond the world morals. A place with no god or kings, only man.                             A civilization who uses science to explore the secrets of the cosmos and ourselves. But we need to be ruthless. We ca not improve our way of live if it means destroying our very own planet. 
</p><p>But do not worry, Eden I dreamed about is not full of my existential nihilism. I believe that your lives could have meaning, although our existence is by itself meaningless. I think value is relative, like one man is trash is another mans treasure. We may be merely a speck of dust flowing though the cosmos, but what if it does not matter. I mean we live once then become inorganic matter. So what if we do not need value on a giant scale, but value only on our little mediocre lives. You do not see ants killing themselves when they are shown the mighty strength and power of a toddler. We should be the same. We should find value in our lives, value to ourselves, nobody else is. Like a dog who does not care how many bones there are, he only cares about what he can do, and finds humor in it. 
</p><p>Before when I saw an average teen, I felt pity, after all what value could his life have? Days spent in social media, completely manipulated by advertising, and Sundays in the church begging to finally reach his artificial goals. But now I realize that it does not matter. His still made of the same organism as me. He will die and so will I. If he thinks his life has meaning then who am I to say he is wrong? I think each one of us should find a purpose in our existence.
</p><p>Moving on. Before we can rebuild, we need to destroy. We live in a world meant to support only three quarters of our total population. Our oil, carbon and gas reserves are almost depleting. Our weapons of destruction keep getting more deadly and in the most unfit hands. Species disappear beneath our pollution footprint. Right now our modern society comforts are the only things keeping us from turning back in to savages, killing each other to survive. That is why, before we can fix ourselves, we need another mass catastrophe. We need to radically cut some billions of us from the planets shoulders. Maybe a cluster of meteors will do the trick, maybe our own radiative weapons, maybe a new antimicrobial resistant bacteria or a contagious mutable virus. Or maybe all of the riots and starvation will do it. And trust me when I say this, it willnot take long before one of these happens. I say less than 20 years. But when it does we have to use that fear to rebuild a society when strict ideologies. To evolve. Since to truly appreciate what you have, you need that to be taken away from you.
</p><p>There is a reason why I have not joined the side of the existential pessimists. That group states that we’ve been killing earth since the industrial revolution, and because of this it is our moral duty to stop reproducing. And fix earth is biosphere. How can we put our selfish need to procreate ahead of the welfare of millions of humans whose resources are compromised by overpopulation? It is not just us affected by overpopulation, but every single species in the planet as well. So we need to collectively save the earth from the humans, and die off or keep our birth rates extremely low.
</p><p>Although I think their arguments are solid, I think its wishful thinking. To dream that we can be united under one goal without disaster. You would have to infect everyone with a singular consciousness, a single purpose. Like the movie Invasion of the body snatchers. But that means sacrificing your individuality for the greater good. And one would argue with that life itself would lose any sort of value or meaning. I think we absolutely need a major catastrophe to make people realize their mistakes. 
</p><p>Now I may hate humans, they are a bunch of greedy selfish ignorant pigs, who know nothing but eat and breed. But I have faith in humanity. Although we are in every way disgusting, we have all of the potential to so much good. We could habit this world without killing it. We could explore space and colonize other planets. We put a man on the moon, we have the technology for renewable energy, we are working on an electromagnetic drive that could take us lightyears away from the galaxy and break the very laws of physics. I choose to have faith in humanity because I’ve seen examples of unity. Did know that in Ww1 Christmas eve 1914, the French, British and German forces agreed on ceasing fire and holding a temporary truce. They left their trenches and spent Christmas sharing drinks and burying their dead. 
</p><p>But that is not all. Did you know that one in seven humans suffer from one or multiple NTDs. The perfect breeding ground for the neglected tropical diseases are isolated communities. Where medicine needs to take an odyssey to reach. These parasites cause imaginable damage. That is why we declared war on them. Now all NTDs are treatable, but governments and health organizations found difficulty in distributing remedies over a long period of time to countries with no infrastructure. That is when the pharmaceutical industry step in and declared they would provide organizations with the necessary drugs for free until the ten diseases were eradicated. Called The London Declaration. And by 2020 it would be 18 billion dollars on drugs given for free. Making it the largest drug donation in history. And they also made sure that the drugs were getting to the people in need. We as a species really can make great things with no other motivation but to help each other. 
</p><p>We are an evolving force to be reckon with. But the only thing keeping us back is still that little gift from Mother Nature. I consider that flaw in the system to be, not a failsafe to lead us to our destruction, but an obstacle to overcame. A final test, to see if we are responsible enough to have this power. Long after we killed god. A final test, to show that we truly deserve to evolve. We have to destroy our selfish and naive behaviors, and work together for a better future for every living being. Only after defeating god and Mother Nature can we work on expanding our intellect to other worlds or maybe galaxies. We could became a type III civilization on the Kardashev scale in a couple of million years. We have the potential. We would overcame all the great filters and solve the Fermi Paradox. Or maybe this is still wishful thinking. 
</p><p>At least that is what I think.</p>
