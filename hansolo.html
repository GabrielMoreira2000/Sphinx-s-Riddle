<p>HELP ME! I need your help big H. Your father sorta of caught me stealling from him...<br>
I just wanted to help the little people for once. But noooo you shouldn't play with fire and all that...<br>
He's got me chained to a rock. He even asked Jacques de l'Ange to paint me. That bastard. Oh! Shit here comes the bird again...</p>
