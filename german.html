<!--Headless Armies-->
<!--In 496 bc the army of King Goujian of Yue put three ranks of criminals in the front of their battle formation.--> 
<!--Their task was to impress the enemy with their ferocity and commitment by chopping off their own heads as soon as battle was joined.--> 
<!--The tactic was a success; while their opponents from the State of Wu were recovering from their astonishment they were overrun by the rest of the Yue army.-->
<!--The convicts, who were condemned men anyway, had been coerced by the threat that if they didn't comply with this plan their families would also be executed.-->
