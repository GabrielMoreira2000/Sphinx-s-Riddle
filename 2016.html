<title>2016 Poem</title>

</head>
<body>
<p class="header" align="center">Here's a poem that I wrote for a New Year's Party.
Please take into consideration that I wrote this for my family.
I'm not in it for the fame or glory. 
So you can do what you want with it.
I made sure that it was filled with meaning, details and hidden jokes.
I honestly hope you enjoy</p>

<h1>2016</h1>
<div class="poem">
<p>Well...2016 is now past.<br>
And boy! It didn't go fast.<br>
Oh! And before you ask about the cast<br>
of this poem, i wrote every word, from the first to the last.<br>
(i can tell you're flabbergast)<br>
Oh 2016... 1 year ago i thought we were gonna
have a blast.<br>
But now that its passed.<br>
I hope we could have a recast.</p>
<p>Time has taken many stars.<br>
And for that i shall spit bars<br>
and rhymes so sick that you'll think <br>
i have SARS.<br>
But really they're just memoirs.<br>
</p>
<p>From the Half-Blood Prince to the actual Prince.<br>
Some were young, others were old.<br>
But they made us laugh and cringe.<br>
And their names will be forever marked in gold.<br> 
</p>
<p>Good Ol'Allan.<br>
He was no fool.<br>
I admireed him like a older brotha.<br>
He was so cool.<br>
His last words were "Yipekayey Mothafucka"</p>
<p>
Kenny Baker is gone.<br>
Yes its true.<br>
Not many knew that<br>
he was the mind beneath R2D2.<br>
</p><p>
Gene Wilder the crazy scientist.<br>
He was really clever..<br>
You may be sad, however<br>
what if i told you that his memes <br>
will live forever.<br>
</p><p>
Majestic Prince<br>
Singer and songwritter.<br>
One of the last talented lighter<br>
of the music industry.<br>

But guess what. His flame will only burn brighter.
</p>
<p>Speaking of fighters.</p>

<p>Damn Muhamed Ali.<br>
The one that foat like a butterfly<br>
and stang like a bee,<br>
plagued by Pakinsons.<br>
But his soul shall forever be free.<br>
</p>
<p>David Bowie, lighting on the face<br>
but he ain't Potter.<br>
He's hotter than Janer<br>
and adorable as an otter..<br>
He used to make parents lock up their daughters<br>
</p>
<p>Cohen, he is now in a better place,<br>
let me show ya.<br>
Right now he is playing in heaven.<br>
Singing Hallelujah.
Ah..</p>

<p>Another one is Fidel Castro.<br>
Truly a sad day.<br>
He spend his whole life fighting capitalism.<br>
And died on Black Friday...<br>
</p>
<p>George Michael is gone,<br>
and can we move on?<br>
I mean.. He didn't woke up<br>
to go go take care of unfinished business.<br>
Looks like this year was his last Christmas.<br>
</p>
<p>Princess Leia passed away.<br>
Sure, she did other roles,<br>
but be real! She was PL<br>
and she left with holes in our souls.<br>
</p>
<p>On the next day Debbie Reynolds died.<br>
It would seen that for a mother<br>
the grief of losing a daughter<br>
is too much to suffer and recover.<br>
</p>
<p>Unfortunaly every year there are some widows.<br>
But when God closes a door...<br>
He opens a window.</p>
<p>
This year wasn't all bad.<br>
Good things happen too..<br>
It was the year of birth and <br>
death of Pokemon Go.<br>
It was the end of all memes<br>
when the oscar was nominated to Leo.<br>
Deadpool came out to defeat is foe, Francis.<br>
Dylan got a Nobel.. Oh, and who could forget?!<br>
Portugal won the Euro.<br>
The Bureau is still investigating Hillary.<br>
And the best one of all. Americans hate of<br>
Islam is continuing to grow. I'm kidding!!<br>
Let me see...What else happen..<br>
We had the Olympic Games. With a low case of doping.<br>
I went to Comic Con cosplaying.<br>
I was so cool, that even the moon came out<br>
closer to see what was happening.<br>
</p>
<p>Oh, and this year Run for the Whitehouse<br>
don't get me started. Huh, huh..<br>
</p>
<p>America is now doomed.<br>
Its entire election has like<br>
a season of cartoons.<br>
There was Hillary running for the Whitehouse.<br>
Again! With her 100.000$ blouse.<br>
</p>
<p>When she lost, i bet she was like<br>
(i quit, Donald, i submit). Wait..<br>
This is a good rhyme, so sit before you're hit<br>
with this lit misfit that i'ma transmit.<br>
Hillary, you're a hypocrite, with a counterfeit outfit.<br>
Who says she's fit for the job. But when it comes down to wit,<br>
she's like Agent Smith-"Shit.."<br>
I bet she is enjoying her banana split<br>
before Donald throws her in a pitt.<br>
And next time you wanna see her,<br>
you gonna need a permit.<br>
Because she spended her time trying to break The Glass Celling.<br>
Altrough she don't admit. But the only crack she found was Donald's <br>
ass pressed against it.<br>
</p>
<p>Speaking of Donald,<br>
with that crappy haircut.<br>
I bet when it rains<br>
he smells like a wet mutt.<br>
But! I'm here to tell facts not spit out disstracks,<br>
altrough Donald can't tell the difference<br>
between Iran and Iraq.<br>
So Donald stop asking Bill<br>
for Lewinsky's numba and go<br>
talk to your momma abot the claims<br>
that the founder of ISIS is Obama.<br>
And now we can enjoy America's fall.<br>
JK. I just wanna see the wall.<br>
</p>
<p>This is what CNN told us about 2016.<br>
It was the biggest crap that i've ever seen.<br>
Let me summarize the newscast of one year.<br>
</p>
<p>Terrorists are growing near.<br>
A gorilla died escaping the zoo.<br>
Kanye will soon have no career.<br>
And the next person to have Ebola is probably you.<br>
Its this type of fear<br>
that we spread on the news.<br>
No matter how soft or lazy that <br>
will get us views.<br>
</p>
<p>Another news that are more underground<br>
are the following: Vines got shutdown.<br>
And Merica and Australia are now dealing with killer clowns.<br>
</p>
<p>Sooo!.. We can all agreed that <br>
this year had its ups and downs.<br>
And will next year be better? Who knows?..<br>
</p>
<p>But now we need to throw our worries in a ditch.<br>
And say, loud and proudly,<br>
Please 2017 don't be a bitch.</p><br>
