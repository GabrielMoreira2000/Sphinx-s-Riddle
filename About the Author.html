<h1>About the Author</h1>
<div align="center">
<p>By the time I upload this, the year is 2017.
My name is Gabriel Moreira, I'm a 16 year-old from the
rainy north of Portugal.<br>
I am a gamer/geek/otaku. I thought of this little project when
I was really bored, one day.<br>
I've been always into riddles. Solving and creating them.
I wanted to build this website for a good friend of mine, who shares
my passion in riddles, as a birthday present.<br>
So I invested a month of my free time to learn HTML and CSS, witch
later used to craft this website from scratch.
<br>
I like to keep myself of the grid as much as possible.
So you won't find me in any social network.
BUT if you liked the website and/or are interested in
a larger and more complex one, send me an email
at (thereisnosuchthingasafish@gmail.com) if you want
to send hate, that's cool too!<br>
It would also be great if you reported any errors that
you manage to find.
</p>
<h2>DON'T SEND ANY ATTACHMENTS I WILL NOT OPEN OR VIEW THEM!
</h2>
<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
