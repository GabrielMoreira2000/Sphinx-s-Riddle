<p>This is my story
<br>One day, after I fell from the stairs, I got up and saw a mysterious figure<br>
(He smelled like a wet dog) He said "Its time for your judgment, and I'm afraid you bring a heavy heart"<br>
"For your sin is Always negleting urba books in school". Then he reached for my chest, but hesitated when he saw my necklace.<br>
Hesitaded long enough until his phone started to ring... He said "Oh shit its Kebe I gotta go".<br>
And that's how I survived! All thanks to my necklace of life.</p>
