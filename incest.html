<!--'Floating Gold', also known as 'Whale’s Pearl' or 'Sea Gold', is a fatty substance that sperm whales secrete from their intestines, properly known as ambergris. 
It is made up of the indigestible parts from a sperm whale's diet, mainly beaks of giant squid.
It floats to the ocean’s surface where, over time, it oxidises and the water in it evaporates. 
Eventually it breaks into smaller chunks, becomes grey and waxy and starts to smell nice, being likened to pine or mulch or even tobacco. 
This process takes roughly 10 years.
