<p>I lived a full live, I would say. I mean I was pretty terrible at everything.<br>
My father died from a disease and my mother was poisoned.<br>
I was nasty at my job (the 1º of my country really) I kept finding love,
but after my sixth wife I decided to stop.<br> I didn't have the temper of a budist, just ask my dead son.<br>
I've made some mistakes, I admit. But the worst one was not being able to finish that game of chess I was doing...</p>
